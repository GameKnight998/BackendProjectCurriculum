# Module 03 Visual Assets

This folder contains diagrams and images used in the Module 03 lessons.

## Needed Assets

The following visual aids would enhance the lessons but are not required for functionality:

### 1. type-safety-example.png
**Used in:** 01-why-typescript.md

A diagram showing how TypeScript catches errors at compile time vs JavaScript catching them at runtime. Could show:
- Split screen: JavaScript vs TypeScript
- Timeline showing when errors are caught
- Example of passing wrong type to function

### 2. interface-diagram.png
**Used in:** 03-interfaces-types.md

A visual representation of an interface defining an object's shape. Could show:
- Interface definition with property types
- Multiple objects conforming to the interface
- An object that doesn't match (with X or error indicator)
- Comparison to C++ struct

## Creating These Assets

Recommended tools:
- Excalidraw (https://excalidraw.com) - Simple, hand-drawn style
- Draw.io (https://draw.io) - Professional diagrams
- Figma - For more polished designs
- PowerPoint/Keynote - Quick mockups

Keep diagrams:
- Simple and clean
- Appropriate for 7th-9th graders
- Under 500KB file size
- PNG format with transparent backgrounds when possible

## Note to Students

These lessons are fully functional without the diagrams. The visual assets are supplementary materials that can be added later to enhance understanding.
