## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is JavaScript with **type annotations**. Think of it as JavaScript's more careful cousin - it checks your work before letting your code run.

Here's the key thing to understand: **All JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code**. TypeScript just adds optional types on top.

```typescript
// This is valid JavaScript AND TypeScript
const name = "Alex";
console.log(name);

// This is TypeScript with types added
const name: string = "Alex";
console.log(name);
```

## The Problem TypeScript Solves

Let's look at a bug that JavaScript won't catch until runtime:

```javascript
// JavaScript - looks fine, but has a bug
function calculateAge(birthYear) {
  const currentYear = 2025;
  return currentYear - birthYear;
}

// Oops! Passed a string instead of a number
const age = calculateAge("2005");
console.log(age); // NaN (Not a Number) - bug only shows when you run it!
```

In JavaScript, this code runs but gives a wrong answer. You might not notice until a user reports a bug in production.

Now the same code in TypeScript:

```typescript
// TypeScript - catches the bug before running
function calculateAge(birthYear: number): number {
  const currentYear = 2025;
  return currentYear - birthYear;
}

// TypeScript ERROR: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
const age = calculateAge("2005"); // Won't even compile!
```

TypeScript catches this error **before you run the code**. Your editor will show a red squiggly line immediately.

## Comparing to C++

If you've used C++ before, TypeScript types will feel familiar:

```cpp
// C++
int calculateAge(int birthYear) {
  int currentYear = 2025;
  return currentYear - birthYear;
}
```

```typescript
// TypeScript
function calculateAge(birthYear: number): number {
  const currentYear = 2025;
  return currentYear - birthYear;
}
```

Both languages check types at compile time. The main difference? TypeScript compiles to JavaScript and runs in the browser or Node.js.

## Real-World Example: User Objects

Imagine you're building a sports coaching platform. Without types, bugs like this can happen:

```javascript
// JavaScript - no type checking
function enrollStudent(user, classId) {
  // Expects user.id to be a number
  return fetch(`/api/enroll/${user.id}/${classId}`);
}

const student = {
  name: "Jordan",
  // Oops! Forgot to include id
};

enrollStudent(student, 101); // Bug: undefined in URL
```

With TypeScript, you define what a User should look like:

```typescript
// TypeScript - catches missing properties
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  role: string;
}

function enrollStudent(user: User, classId: number) {
  return fetch(`/api/enroll/${user.id}/${classId}`);
}

const student = {
  name: "Jordan",
  // TypeScript ERROR: Property 'id' is missing!
};

enrollStudent(student, 101); // Won't compile
```

TypeScript won't let you forget required fields. It's like having a helper that double-checks your work.

## Benefits of TypeScript

### 1. Catch Errors Early
Find bugs while you're writing code, not when users report them.

### 2. Better IDE Support
Your code editor can:
- Autocomplete property names
- Show what parameters a function expects
- Jump to definitions easily

### 3. Self-Documenting Code
Types explain what your code does:

```typescript
// You immediately know what this function needs and returns
function getClassesByInstructor(instructorId: number): Class[] {
  // ...
}
```

### 4. Easier Refactoring
When you change a type, TypeScript shows you everywhere that needs updating.

### 5. Fewer Tests Needed
Type checking handles many simple bugs that you'd otherwise need tests for.

## How TypeScript Works

Here's the workflow:

1. **Write TypeScript** (`.ts` files)
2. **TypeScript Compiler checks types** - catches errors
3. **Compiler generates JavaScript** (`.js` files)
4. **JavaScript runs** in Node.js or browser

```bash
# Install TypeScript
npm install -g typescript

# Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
tsc myfile.ts

# Creates myfile.js (JavaScript) from myfile.ts (TypeScript)
```

The generated JavaScript has all the type annotations removed - browsers and Node.js only understand JavaScript.

## When to Use TypeScript

**Use TypeScript for:**
- Projects that will be maintained long-term
- Team projects (types help everyone understand the code)
- Backend APIs (catch data validation errors)
- Any project larger than a few files

**JavaScript might be fine for:**
- Very small scripts
- Quick prototypes
- Learning basic programming concepts

For professional backend development, **TypeScript is the standard**. Most companies building serious applications use it.

## TypeScript Popularity

Major companies using TypeScript:
- Microsoft (created TypeScript)
- Google (Angular framework)
- Facebook/Meta (React can use TypeScript)
- Airbnb
- Shopify
- Slack

According to developer surveys, TypeScript is consistently one of the most loved programming languages.

## Common Misconceptions

**"TypeScript makes JavaScript slower"**
False. TypeScript compiles to regular JavaScript. There's zero runtime performance difference.

**"TypeScript is a different language"**
Technically true, but it's better to think of it as JavaScript + types. You're still writing JavaScript logic.

**"TypeScript means writing more code"**
Sometimes, but it prevents bugs that would require even more code to fix later. It's an investment that pays off.

**"I need to type everything"**
No! TypeScript can infer many types automatically. You only add types where they add value.

## Try It Yourself

Let's see type checking in action. What will happen here?

```typescript
function greetUser(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

greetUser(123); // What error will TypeScript show?
```

TypeScript will say: "Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'."

It won't let you pass a number where a string is expected.

## Key Takeaways

- TypeScript is JavaScript with optional type annotations
- It catches bugs at compile time, before code runs
- Types make code more predictable and easier to maintain
- All JavaScript is valid TypeScript
- TypeScript compiles to regular JavaScript
- Professional backends almost always use TypeScript

2. When does TypeScript check for errors - at compile time or runtime?
3. Can you run TypeScript directly in Node.js? Why or why not?
4. How is TypeScript similar to C++?
5. Why do large companies prefer TypeScript for their codebases?
