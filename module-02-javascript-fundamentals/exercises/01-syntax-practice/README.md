# Exercise 1: JavaScript Syntax Practice

## Objective

Get comfortable with basic JavaScript syntax including variables, conditionals, loops, and basic functions.

**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê
**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Completed Lesson 1: JavaScript Review
- Understanding of variables (`const`, `let`)
- Basic knowledge of functions and loops

## Instructions

Open `practice.js` and complete all the TODO comments. Each function has instructions explaining what it should do.

The file includes exercises for:
1. Variables and template literals
2. Basic functions
3. Conditionals
4. Loops and arrays
5. String and array methods

## How to Run

```bash
# Run the file to see your output
node practice.js
```

## What You'll Practice

- Using `const` and `let` appropriately
- Writing template literals with backticks
- Creating functions with arrow syntax
- Using if/else statements
- Looping through arrays
- Working with string and array methods

## Tips

- Use `const` by default, only use `let` if you need to reassign
- Remember to use backticks (`) for template literals, not quotes
- Test each function as you complete it by uncommenting the test code at the bottom

## Expected Output

When complete, running `node practice.js` should produce output showing that all your functions work correctly.

## Learning Goals

After completing this exercise, you should be comfortable with:
- JavaScript variable declarations
- Basic function syntax
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Working with strings and arrays
- Template literals for string interpolation
