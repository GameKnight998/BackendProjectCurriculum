# Exercise 3: Objects and JSON

## Objective

Master working with JavaScript objects, destructuring, and JSON parsing/stringifying for real-world data manipulation.

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐
**Estimated Time:** 35 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Completed Lesson 3: Objects & JSON
- Understanding of object literals
- Knowledge of dot notation and bracket notation
- Familiarity with array methods

## Instructions

Open `practice.js` and complete all the TODO comments. You'll work with the sample data in `data.json` to practice:
1. Creating and manipulating objects
2. Destructuring objects and arrays
3. Working with JSON data
4. Combining objects and arrays

## How to Run

```bash
node practice.js
```

## What You'll Practice

- Creating object literals
- Accessing object properties (dot and bracket notation)
- Object destructuring
- Array destructuring
- Spread operator with objects
- JSON parsing and stringifying
- Working with nested objects
- Transforming data structures

## Tips

- Use destructuring to make your code cleaner and more readable
- Remember: JSON.parse() converts strings to objects
- JSON.stringify() converts objects to strings
- The spread operator (...) is useful for copying/merging objects
- Dot notation is simpler, but bracket notation lets you use variables

## Sample Data

The `data.json` file contains sample data for a sports coaching business with:
- Students enrolled in various sports classes
- Class schedules and information
- Student contact information
- Performance tracking data

## Learning Goals

After completing this exercise, you should be comfortable with:
- Creating and manipulating complex objects
- Using destructuring to extract values
- Converting between JSON and JavaScript objects
- Working with nested data structures
- Combining objects and arrays for real-world scenarios
