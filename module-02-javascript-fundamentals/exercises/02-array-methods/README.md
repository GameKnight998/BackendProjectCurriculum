# Exercise 2: Array Methods

## Objective

Master array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`, and `forEach` using functional programming approaches.

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Completed Lesson 2: Functions & Arrays
- Understanding of arrow functions
- Knowledge of array methods

## Instructions

Open `exercises.js` and complete all the TODO comments. You should use array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.) instead of traditional loops wherever possible.

## How to Run

```bash
node exercises.js
```

## What You'll Practice

- Using `map()` to transform arrays
- Using `filter()` to select elements
- Using `reduce()` to combine values
- Using `find()` to search arrays
- Chaining multiple array methods
- Working with arrays of objects

## Tips

- Remember: `map` returns an array of the same length
- `filter` returns an array that might be shorter
- `reduce` returns a single value
- Chain methods together for complex operations
- Arrow functions are perfect for array methods

## Learning Goals

After completing this exercise, you should be comfortable with:
- Transforming data with `map`
- Filtering data with `filter`
- Aggregating data with `reduce`
- Finding specific elements with `find`
- Chaining array methods for complex operations
