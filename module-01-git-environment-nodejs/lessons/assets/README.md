# Module 01 Visual Assets

This folder should contain visual diagrams and images referenced in the lessons.

## Required Images

### git-workflow.png
A diagram showing the Git fork/clone/commit/push workflow:
- Fork repository on GitHub
- Clone to local computer
- Make changes
- Stage with git add
- Commit with message
- Push to GitHub

**Suggested tool:** Excalidraw, draw.io, or Figma

### terminal-commands.png
A visual reference card showing common terminal commands:
- Navigation: pwd, ls, cd
- File operations: touch, mkdir, rm, cp, mv
- Utilities: cat, clear
- Tips: Tab completion, up arrow

**Suggested tool:** Create a simple infographic or diagram

### nodejs-architecture.png
A diagram showing Node.js architecture:
- JavaScript code
- V8 Engine
- Node.js APIs
- Event Loop
- Operating System

**Suggested tool:** Diagram showing the flow from code to execution

## Creating These Images

1. Use any diagram tool you prefer (Excalidraw, draw.io, Figma, etc.)
2. Keep them simple and clear
3. Use consistent colors
4. Save as PNG with reasonable file sizes (< 500KB)
5. Ensure they're readable at both small and large sizes
6. Consider a light background for easy viewing in documentation

## Placeholder Note

Currently, these images are referenced in the lessons but not yet created. Students can complete the module without them, but the images would significantly enhance understanding.

**Priority:** Medium - Module is functional without them, but they add significant value.
