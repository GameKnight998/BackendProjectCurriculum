## What Students Will Learn

By completing Module 01, students will be able to:

1. **Git Skills:**
   - Explain what version control is and why it's important
   - Configure Git with their identity
   - Fork and clone repositories
   - Stage, commit, and push changes
   - Write descriptive commit messages
   - Navigate Git workflows confidently

2. **Command Line Skills:**
   - Navigate file systems using the terminal
   - Create, move, copy, and delete files and directories
   - Use essential commands: pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, touch, rm, cp, mv
   - Utilize shortcuts like tab completion
   - Feel comfortable in a terminal environment

3. **Node.js & npm Skills:**
   - Understand what Node.js is and how it differs from browser JavaScript
   - Run JavaScript files with Node.js
   - Create and understand package.json files
   - Install and manage npm packages
   - Differentiate between dependencies and devDependencies
   - Create and run npm scripts
   - Navigate the npm ecosystem

## Integration Points

This module prepares students for:
- **Module 02:** JavaScript Fundamentals - Students will use Node.js to run JavaScript code
- **All Future Modules:** Git workflow will be used throughout for assignments
- **All Future Modules:** Terminal commands will be essential for running servers, tests, etc.
- **All Future Modules:** npm will manage all project dependencies

## Known Gaps / Future Enhancements

### Missing Visual Assets (Non-Critical)
- git-workflow.png
- terminal-commands.png
- nodejs-architecture.png

**Impact:** Low - Module is fully functional without these. They would enhance visual learning but are not required.

**Priority:** Medium - Create when time allows

### Potential Enhancements (Optional)
- Video walkthroughs for visual learners
- Interactive Git tutorial integration
- More advanced Git topics in bonus section (branches, merging)
- Windows-specific command line guide

## Testing the Module

To test this module:

```bash
# Run the module tests
npm run test:module-01
```

**Expected Result:** Tests will fail until students complete the homework, but the test file itself should run without errors.

## Time Estimates

- **Lessons:** 2 hours (45 + 30 + 45 minutes)
- **Exercises:** 1.5 hours (30 + 20 + 30 minutes)
- **Homework:** 2-3 hours
- **Total Module Time:** 5.5-6.5 hours

This aligns with the 1-2 week estimate (assuming 1.5 hour weekly class + homework time).

## Success Criteria Met

From the main specification, this module meets all requirements:

- [x] Complete module README with overview and learning objectives
- [x] All lesson files with content written for target audience
- [x] Exercise folders with clear instructions
- [x] Homework folder with detailed README
- [x] Starter code that runs without errors
- [x] TODO comments marking student work
- [x] Complete test suite
- [x] Friendly, conversational tone
- [x] Comparisons to C++ concepts
- [x] Code examples with comments
- [x] Common pitfalls highlighted
- [x] Progressive difficulty appropriate for Module 01

## Next Steps

1. **Optional:** Create the visual assets (diagrams)
2. **Test with students:** If possible, have actual students work through the module
3. **Iterate based on feedback**
4. **Move to Module 02:** JavaScript Fundamentals

## Maintainer Notes

- All links are relative and should work when the repository is cloned
- Test file paths are correct relative to project root
- No external dependencies required for Module 01 content
- All content follows the style guidelines (no emojis in code/markdown per CLAUDE.md)
- Content is self-contained - students don't need to research external resources for core requirements

---

**Module Status:** Ready for student use
**Recommended Action:** Begin Module 02 creation
